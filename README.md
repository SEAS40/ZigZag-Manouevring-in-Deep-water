# ZigZag Maneuvering in Deep Water

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **ZigZag Manoeuvring in Deep Water** simulation. This project utilizes MATLAB to delve into the intricacies of zigzag manoeuvres of a vessel in deep water. Through the integration of essential concepts like the Equation of Motion, hydrodynamic coefficients and forces, the Euler scheme, and acceleration in the ship's reference frame, this simulation offers valuable insights into the dynamics of zigzag manoeuvres.

## Overview

In the maritime world, understanding the zigzag manoeuvres of ships is of paramount importance for safe and efficient navigation. This repository employs MATLAB to simulate and study these zigzag manoeuvres in deep water conditions. The foundation of the simulation rests upon the Equation of Motion, which governs the vessel's behaviour during these complex manoeuvres. The integration of hydrodynamic coefficients and forces adds a layer of realism to the simulation, accurately capturing the interaction between the ship and the water.

To achieve accurate results, the simulation employs the Euler scheme for numerical integration, ensuring precise tracking of the vessel's trajectory. Moreover, the simulation accounts for acceleration in the ship's reference frame, further enhancing the realism of the manoeuvre.

## First Overshoot Angle Constraint

A noteworthy aspect of this simulation is the consideration of the first overshoot angle during a 20/20 zig-zag manoeuvre test. To adhere to safety standards, the simulation ensures that the first overshoot angle does not exceed a limit of 25Â°.

Feel free to explore the MATLAB code in this repository to gain insights into zigzag manoeuvres and their implications for maritime navigation.
